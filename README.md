- Step 9 :  Root Cause analysis 

Through root cause analysis, we identify specific problems across various dimensions such as region, country, city, channel, and product. This analysis helps us pinpoint the weak points and understand the underlying reasons behind them.

For example, in a particular country, the drop in sales during a certain quarter may be due to seasonal products that do not sell well during that period. Therefore, we propose replacing these products with others that are more in demand during that time to improve sales performance.

- Step 10 : use Tooltips to provids details

Through the tooltip, we can see the percentage of sales relative to the total sales, the percentage of profit relative to the total profit, and the percentage of cost relative to the total cost.

It also shows monthly sales performance, which helps us identify the months with the highest sales. This insight allows us to reduce costs, ensure product availability, and create targeted promotions during peak sales periods.
